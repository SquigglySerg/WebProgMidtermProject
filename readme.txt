Why our game deserve 100 points:
    


CSS3 Features:
    1) Button: We included a button in our game to start the game and play again after the game
    ends.
    2) Rounded Border: We added a rounded border to the level up box to make it a bit more fancy.
    3) Text Shadow: We gave the title of the game a text shadow to make it stand out a bit more/
    4) Animation + 3D Transform: We combined animation with the 3D transform to make the buttons
    have an animation when the mouse is hovering over them.
