Why our game deserve 100 points:
    To start off, we met all of the technical requirements listed. Our game is entertaining as it
    gets harder and harder as you move up the levels. It actually takes some skills to be able to
    get a higher scores as you repeatedly play the game. To make the game more engaging, we even have
    sound effects for the rock launches and shooting the rocks. It is not just a jump in a figure it
    out yourself game. We have a title screen for the game that gives the instructions on how to play and a
    button to start the game once the player is ready. Even better, the player doesn't need to
    reload the page to play the game again as we have a "Play Again" button on the game over page. 
    With all that in our game, we believe our game should get 100 points.


CSS3 Features:
    1) Button: We included a button in our game to start the game and play again after the game
    ends.
    2) Rounded Border: We added a rounded border to the level up box to make it a bit more fancy.
    3) Text Shadow: We gave the title of the game a text shadow to make it stand out a bit more/
    4) Animation + 3D Transform: We combined animation with the 3D transform to make the buttons
    have an animation when the mouse is hovering over them.

Nifty Features that were a Bear to Implement:
    1) Rock generations and launches: This feature has new rocks being generated for each level
    to be launched at random angles. The speed of the launch also increases as the level
    increases.
    2) Implementing the title screen without the game playing in the background was difficult. We
    wanted to have a title screen with instructions so that new players will know how to play the
    game instead of jumping in right away and trying to figure out the controls. It took a while but
    we were able to get the game to start only after the "Start" button is pressed.
